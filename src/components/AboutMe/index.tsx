          </h3>
          <p className="inline text-4xl font-light align-middle">
            I started creating interactive animations with Flash and
            ActionScript, and later worked as a visual and web designer,
            building rich media ads, dynamic motion graphics, and engaging
            microsites and landing pages.
          </p>
          <p className="text-4xl font-light mt-11">
            I developed expertise with various CMS platforms, contributed to
            multiple web projects, specialized in front-end development, led a
            small team of designers and developers, and have kept learning ever
            since.
